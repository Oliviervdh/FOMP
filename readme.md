FOMP stands for Films Of My Preference. The end result came out like this: https://Oliviervdh.github.io/FOMP-Movie-app/.

This is a fictional project that was created on a request by our Coach at Becode Ghent.

The inspiration for this project was that I wanted to create a movie streaming app that adjust it's selection based on the users mood.

## technologies

The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS and Javascript.


Thanks for reading, Olivier.
